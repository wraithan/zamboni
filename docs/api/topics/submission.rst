Submission
==========

Adding an app follows a few steps, roughly analgous to the flow in a browser.
Validate your app, add it in, update it with the various data and
then request review.

Validate
========

.. note:: The validation does not require you to be authenticated, however you
    cannot create apps from those validations. To validate and submit an app
    you must be authenticated for both steps.

.. http:post:: /api/vi/apps/validation/

    **Request**

    :param manifest: URL to the manifest.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {"manifest": "http://test.app.com/manifest.webapp"}

    Or for a *packaged app*

    :param upload: a dictionary containing the appropriate file data in the upload field.
    :param upload type: the content type.
    :param upload name: the file name.
    :param upload data: the base 64 encoded data.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {"upload": {"type": "application/foo",
                    "data": "UEsDBAo...gAAAAA=",
                    "name": "mozball.zip"}}

    **Response**

    Returns a :ref:`validation <validation-response-label>` result.

    :status 201: successfully created.

.. _validation-response-label:

.. http:get:: /api/vi/apps/validation/(int:id)/

    **Response**

    Returns a particular validation.

    :param id: the id of the validation.
    :param processed: if the validation has been processed. Hosted apps are
        done immediately but packaged apps are queued. Clients will have to
        poll the results URL until the validation has been processed.
    :param valid: if the validation passed.
    :param validation: the resulting validation messages if it failed.
    :status 200: successfully completed.

    Example not processed:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "id": "123",
            "processed": false,
            "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/validation/123/",
            "valid": false,
            "validation": ""
        }

    Example processed and passed:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "id": "123",
            "processed": true,
            "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/validation/123/",
            "valid": true,
            "validation": ""
        }

    Example processed and failed:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "id": "123",
            "processed": true,
            "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/validation/123/",
            "valid": false,
            "validation": {
            "errors": 1, "messages": [{
                "tier": 1,
                "message": "Your manifest must be served with the HTTP header \"Content-Type: application/x-web-app-manifest+json\". We saw \"text/html; charset=utf-8\".",
                "type": "error"
            }],
        }

Enabling an App
===============

.. note:: Requires authentication and a successfully created app.

.. http:patch:: /api/v1/apps/status/(int:app_id)/

    **Request**

    :params (optional) status: a status you'd like to move the app too (see
        below).
    :params (optional) disabled_by_user: can be `true` or `false`

    **Response**

    :status 200: successfully completed.
    :status 400: something prevented the transition.


Key statuses are:

  * `incomplete`: incomplete
  * `pending`: pending
  * `public`: public
  * `waiting`: waiting to be public

Valid transitions that users can initiate are:

* *incomplete* to *pending*: call this once your app has been completed and it
  will be added to the Marketplace review queue. This can only be called if all
  the required data is there. If not, you'll get an error containing the
  reason. For example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "error_message": {
                "status": [
                    "You must provide a support email.",
                    "You must provide at least one device type.",
                    "You must provide at least one category.",
                    "You must upload at least one screenshot or video."
                ]
            }
        }

* Once reviewed by the Marketplace review team, the app will be to *public* or
  *waiting to be public*.
* *waiting* to *public*: occurs when the app has been reviewed, but not yet
  been made public.
* *disabled_by_user*: by changing this value from `True` to `False` you can
  enable or disable an app.
